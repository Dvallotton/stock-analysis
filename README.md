## Overview of project
This project was desinged to to analyze multiple stocks to get a clearer picture of their value moving forward. the ending project was to to refactor what we had learned to make it more efficent and prove that we did. 

### Results
this is the code i used in the final challenge.

#### As noted as struggled and only was able to complete by using someone else's code for step 3. it still doesnt completey make sense to me but i do understand the end result of the code just not entirely how it got there. 
Below are the runtimes for the different years.

Overall only ENPH and RUN had a positive return in 2018, those would be the stocks to stick with. 

##### i belive refactoring is and advantage espcially when you are more confident and established with the code. You can make it easier to read and understand this way. A disadvantage is for people of my current skill can end up making it more confusing since we dont yet have a full grasp on what the code is actually doing to get the results we need. 

###### i cannot give a detailed advantage or disadvantage of the original as i do not completely understand all the code. This is what I assume a common theme among early/new developers and will only get better with more time and practice.
